# Hands-on Machine Learning Tutorial for Astrophysics

[Run this tutorial using Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/nshaud/ml_for_astro/blob/master/Hands_on_ML_for_astrophysics.ipynb)

This tutorial demonstrates some simple usecases of machine learning and deep learning for astrophysicians.
It was first showcased during the [SFtools-Bigdata](https://sftools-bigdata.sciencesconf.org/) workshop in november 2020.

**Part 1** shows how to use scikit-learn to train shallow statistical models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests on tabular data
for star type classification based on their physical properties (temperature/radius/luminosity).

**Part 2** demonstrates how to work with unstructured data such as images. It moves gradually from hand-crafted features (histogram of gradients) to
learnt features using deep convolutional networks.

**Part 3** gives examples of nice party tricks achievable using deep features such as clustering in 2D space, image retrieval, fine-tuning pretrained
networks and so on.

Feel free to open an issue or a pull request if you find any error or problem in this code.
